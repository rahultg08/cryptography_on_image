# Visual steganography using AES-algorithm

## Using Python
Python program that encrypts and decrypts the image files accurately. This will help in minimising the problem of data theft and leaks of other sensitive information. The file that we obtained after encryption is very safe and no cryptanalytic attacks. Data can be sent on a network without compromise of eavesdropping. At the receiver side, the receiver has code for decrypting the image so that data integrity is garunteed.
